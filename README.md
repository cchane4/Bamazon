Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront program

User will Import the data from the table(products) to a database called Bamazon. 
Through the Terminal/Git, the user will be prompted to answer 2 questions which make up an order request. 
If the request can be filled, the program will log the user's request, update the database and return the total. 
If the database shows that the item is out of stock or if the user requests an amount that exceeds the supply,
the program will send the user an "insufficient quantity" message.
